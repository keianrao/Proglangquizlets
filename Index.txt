Problem 1
---
Given a list of 2D points, of integer coordinates,
(1) Sort them by X;

(2) For any (integer) X with no point covering it, make one up using linear interpolation on the existing points. (As in, the nearest existing point to its left and right, draw a straight line between them and use that line to plot points over the uncovered Xes).

(3) Find and record the third-smallest Y value amongst the new list of points.

(4) Assemble the new list of points into a (sorted) binary tree.

(5) Binary search for the recorded third-smallest Y value, recording the values of the nodes you visited along the way (including the root).

This is some really cheesy algorithms problems, but let's see if you can survive what is basically five separate ones in a row.
